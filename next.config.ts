/**
 * NEXT.JS CONFIGURATION FILE (TypeScript)
 * 
 * This file configures Next.js build and runtime settings for the school
 * management system using TypeScript. It provides type-safe configuration
 * and handles build optimizations.
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * - Provides type-safe Next.js configuration
 * - Configures build settings and experimental features
 * - Handles TypeScript-specific optimizations
 * - Sets up development and production environments
 * 
 * CONFIGURATION DETAILS:
 * - TypeScript integration for better development experience
 * - Build optimizations for production deployment
 * - Development server configuration
 * - Static file handling and routing
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * This file is automatically loaded by Next.js during build and development.
 * Changes require restarting the development server to take effect.
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * This is the TypeScript version of Next.js config. It provides better
 * type safety compared to the JavaScript version (next.config.js).
